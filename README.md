# 🍎🍊 Fruit Classifier using Teachable Machine and Google Colab

A simple image classification project that uses Teachable Machine to identify fruits — specifically apples and oranges — and test them using Google Colab.

## 🎯 Project Goal

Learn how to:

- Train a custom image classification model using Teachable Machine  
- Export the model in TensorFlow Keras format  
- Load and use the model in Python  
- Preprocess input images and predict their class  
- Test multiple images and view confidence scores  

---

## 📸 Dataset

- **Class 1**: Apple 🍎  
- **Class 2**: Orange 🍊  
- Each class contains 4 training images uploaded via webcam and file upload options.

---

## 🧠 Model Training

- Trained using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- The model can distinguish between apples and oranges with high accuracy.


## ✅ Sample Output

- 🍎 Apple classified as **Class 1** with **94% confidence**
- 🍊 Orange classified as **Class 2** with **99% confidence**
